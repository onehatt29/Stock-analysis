#### Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
###### The AllStocks Analysis purpose was constructed to evaluate the growth of DQ stocks over time. The results will determine if the customer will continue with the stock or divest.


## Results: Using images and examples of your code compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.


#### Based on the results the DQ stock has steadily decreased from 2017 to 2018 in 2017 the had a daily closing rate of 35,796,200 compared to 2018 of 107.873,900.

## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
#### Refactoring code can be very useful and time-saving writing code repeatedly can be time-consuming, refactoring code by changing some routines can also help the code run faster and work better. The con of refactoring code if youâ€™re continually doing it, Will limit your programming skills.


## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
##### Refactoring worked because it increased the processing time of the code I was running and saved the time of trying to rewrite the code  .
